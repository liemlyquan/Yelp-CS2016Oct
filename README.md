# Yelp

A Yelp search application

### Time spent:
approximately 8 hours in total

### Feature
##### Required
* [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
* [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
* [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
* [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
* [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
* [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch
* [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.

##### Optional
* [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results
* [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results
* [ ] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app.
* [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.
* [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

##### Additional
* [x] Make use of location services to provide more accurate results. 

### Known issues
*  Location will have weird behavior in unsupported countries by Yelp

### Reflection
* Learning how to use delegate and custom table view. But due to high workload, I didn't have chance to implement any optional feature this week.
